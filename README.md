###Changelog:<br/>
	- Jan 10th, 2017 :: Added to GitHub<br/>
	
###Tweaks:<br/>
	- Added duplicator support (anti-noclip settings are saved across dupes, rather than having to reapply anti-noclip again).<br/>
	- Added ability to force the tooltip to always show, even when the anti-noclip tool isn't being used (useful for debugging) (tickbox).<br/>
	- Added ability to show/hide notifications when creating/copying/removing anti-noclip controllers (tickbox).<br/>
	- Added ability to enable/disable playing notification sounds when creating/copying/removing anti-noclip controllers (tickbox).<br/>
	- Added support for localization of every phrase in the tool menu and tooltip HUD (Localify module).<br/>
	- Added ability to change localization (combobox).  
	
###Multi-language Support:<br/>
	- TODO: Ask for translations :)<br/>
