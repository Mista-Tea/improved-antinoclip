### Author:
	- Original  :: RabidToaster (STEAM_0:1:9334395)
	- Rewritten :: Mista Tea    (STEAM_0:0:27507323)
	
### Changelog:
	- Jan 10th, 2017 :: Added to GitHub
	
### Tweaks:
	- Added duplicator support (anti-noclip settings are saved across dupes, rather than having to reapply anti-noclip again).
	- Added ability to force the tooltip to always show, even when the anti-noclip tool isn't being used (useful for debugging) (tickbox).
	- Added ability to show/hide notifications when creating/copying/removing anti-noclip controllers (tickbox).
	- Added ability to enable/disable playing notification sounds when creating/copying/removing anti-noclip controllers (tickbox).
	- Added support for localization of every phrase in the tool menu and tooltip HUD (Localify module).
	- Added ability to change localization (combobox).
	
### Multi-language Support:
	- TODO: Ask for translations :)
